# House Price Prediction üè°üí∞

Predicting house prices is an essential task in the real estate market. This project utilizes Linear Regression to predict house prices based on key features like the number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and square footage area. 

## Introduction

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! In this project, we leverage the power of Machine Learning, particularly Linear Regression, to estimate house prices based on a few fundamental factors. By analyzing data on the number of rooms, bedrooms, and square footage area, we aim to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast house prices.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide a reliable method for predicting house prices, which can be invaluable for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market. By employing Linear Regression, we can make informed decisions regarding property investments, pricing strategies, and market trends.

### Features
- **Number of Rooms:** The total number of rooms in the house.
- **Number of Bedrooms:** The total number of bedrooms in the house.
- **Square Footage Area:** The total area of the house in square feet.

### Methodology
We employ Linear Regression, a popular Machine Learning algorithm, to establish a mathematical relationship between the input features (number of rooms, number of bedrooms, square footage area) and the target variable (house price). This enables us to predict house prices based on the given features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.0 or higher)
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/house-price-prediction.git
```

Install the required libraries using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
1. Prepare your dataset containing information about the number of rooms, bedrooms, square footage area, and corresponding house prices.
2. Run the `house_price_prediction.py` script.
3. Input your dataset and follow the prompts.
4. The script will train the Linear Regression model and generate predictions for house prices.
